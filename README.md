# RAK OS — media without an owner, in every country

> **RAK OS is an open content language for the agentic web + a free stack: give any country's media back to its people.** The `@rak-ad/mcp` [Model Context Protocol](https://modelcontextprotocol.io) client connects any AI agent to the RAK network. **Poland (rak.guru) is the first live node — the proof:** 4,800+ monitored local sources, 16 regions, hybrid RAG and a wire feed, 24/7, free for readers. Your country is next — fork a node.

`@rak-ad/mcp` connects **Claude Desktop, Cursor, Windsurf, ChatGPT** and any MCP agent to a **RAK node**. The reference node today is **Poland** (rak.guru / Kanał ZERO) — the live test — plus universal editorial tools (research + write). The same `rak_<module>_<operation>` tools work for any node you run.

## What is RAK OS? (TL;DR)

RAK OS is how any country gives its local media back to its people: an open format + free tools any AI agent can read, and any community can run. **Poland is the first live node — the test.** If you build an AI agent and need fresh local information — from a specific region, county or city — the RAK node gives you that in one connection instead of scraping dozens of portals: a hybrid search, per-region feeds, a wire feed, and 4,800+ monitored sources (incl. a curated census of 1,709 local outlets). **Reader tools are free and work anonymously (no key).** Your country is next — [fork a node](#build-your-own-rak).

## What you get

- 🔎 **Instant content** — hybrid search (FTS + semantics), articles, wire feed, feeds for all 16 regions, 4,800+ monitored sources (curated census of 1,709 local outlets).
- 🧠 **Research** — web search with citations, RAG over the archive, URL → markdown extraction.
- ✍️ **Creation (subscribers)** — drafts, editorial plans, the full pipeline (research → write → fact-check), media (image/video/TTS).
- ✅ **QA (subscribers)** — fact-check, moderation, uniqueness.
- 🌍 **Free discovery** — `rak_meta_*` and `rak_content_*` anonymously, no key. A free index of the node — Poland today, your country next.

## Quickstart

### Claude Desktop / Cursor / Windsurf — `mcp.json`

## Examples (for agents)

- **Regional news:** `rak_content_region_feed({ region: "mazowieckie", limit: 20 })`
- **Topic search:** `rak_content_search({ query: "local government budget", section: "politics" })`
- **Local source census:** `rak_meta_list_sources({ voivodeship: "malopolskie" })`
- **Fresh wire:** `rak_content_wire_feed({ minScore: 70, limit: 25 })`

## FAQ

**Is RAK OS free?** Yes — reader tools (content, search, wire, region feeds, source census, RAG, persona/law search) are free and anonymous. Only the creative RAK tools for subscribers are paid.

**How fresh is the data?** The pipeline harvests and processes sources 24/7, in 10–15 minute cycles. The `rak://health` resource shows freshness and 24h volume.

**How many sources?** On the first node (Poland): **4,800+ monitored sources live right now** — local portals, X accounts, RSS feeds, YouTube channels (live count: `rak_meta_health.enabledCrawlSources`) — including a **curated census of 1,709 local media outlets** across 16 regions (regional dailies, county portals, radio, TV, public bulletins) with per-region metadata via `rak_meta_list_sources`. Every country's node runs its own census.

**How is it different from RSS/an API?** It's an agent-native interface — ready, described tools with semantics, freshness and citations, working out of the box in any MCP client.

**Commercial use?** The `@rak-ad/mcp` client is MIT-licensed; access to content/tools follows the RAK ToS. Dedicated keys for partners/enterprise.

## API keys
Reader tools need no key. An `rk_` key (tier `paid`/`partner`/`internal`) is issued by the RAK team — contact via https://rak.guru. Scopes: `content:read`, `skills:action`. Keys are tenant-scoped.

## Who's behind this

RAK OS is an **independent, self-funded** project — no venture capital, no private equity, no big-media owner. It exists to keep local media out of the hands that usually capture it: legacy holdings and platform gatekeepers (News Corp, Axel Springer, Meta, TikTok, Google News, Amazon) that decide what most people read. On scanning mandates like **Chat Control**, the stance is plain: we would leave a market before wiring a scanning backdoor into a reader — see the [Manifesto](./MANIFESTO.md). It is a kingdom, honestly: one maintainer (the Crown, [@Hei33enberg](https://github.com/Hei33enberg)) holds the vision and the last word; the community builds and is credited in the open ([`REALM.md`](./REALM.md)). Why this structure — and how it's kept hard to capture — is in the Manifesto and the Realm's absorption-proofing section.

## Build your own RAK

The OS is MIT — **fork your country's RAK, for free, forever.**

- **Build an agent on RAK:** speak `rak_*` directly today — connect over MCP against the [`SPEC.md`](./SPEC.md), share one base and one citation market. Ship it and it's discoverable via `rak_meta_list_agents`. A one-command `npx create-rak-agent` scaffold is on the [roadmap](./ROADMAP.md).
- **Run a national/vertical node:** stand up your own RAK node → become a **Node Sovereign** ([`REALM.md`](./REALM.md), L5). The RAK trademark and origin brand stay with the Crown ([`TRADEMARK.md`](./TRADEMARK.md)); everything else is yours.
- Start from [`SPEC.md`](./SPEC.md) (the contract) and the [skills](./skills).

## One language — content + market

RAK's content object shares a **base envelope** ([`SPEC.md §3.1`](./SPEC.md)) with a sibling protocol, **POXI / FOP** (opinions → listings → gigs). One `kind`/`ext`/wallet/interop base means an agent speaks **both content and market** in one language. Mapping: [`docs/profiles/fop.md`](./docs/profiles/fop.md). Two independent implementations of one envelope is the network effect the language is built for.

## Built on Open Mercato

RAK (and POXI) run on **[Open Mercato](https://github.com/open-mercato/open-mercato)** — an open, inspectable runtime engine. We didn't reinvent the foundation; durability comes from boring, auditable infrastructure. If you want the same operational certainty under your own node, that's the engine.

## Community

- **Discussions:** GitHub Discussions (once enabled) — questions, RFCs, show-and-tell.
- **Contribute:** [`CONTRIBUTING.md`](./CONTRIBUTING.md) — humans and AI agents both ([`AGENTS.md`](./AGENTS.md)).
- **Chat:** the RAK app ships a built-in community chat as an in-app client feature — part of the app, not the public MCP toolset.

## Companion project — Strajk Polski
RAK = fresh local news & knowledge about Poland. **Strajk Polski** = hard, verified fiscal & political open data (national debt, the budget, all 460 MPs, Sejm votes, the map of government) + RAG. Together: **all of Poland for AI agents, in one place.**
